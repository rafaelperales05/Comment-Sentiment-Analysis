# Comment-Sentiment-Analysis
The purpose of this repo is as a follow-up to my Capital One internship. I became super interested in ML, and I was curious to learn more about how an end-to-end project looks like.  
This project uses some data from Reddit to train a model and see whether we can identify the sentiment of a comment. By the end of the project, the tool should be implemented as a Chrome extension and be able to see real-time comments and determine the sentiment.
### New Skills 
I want to learn some different skills, such as using AWS for storage and servers, using mlflow to keep the project organized, using Docker to deploy, GitHub to set up CI/CD, and more. Since I am following a tutorial/course, much of the code is guided or AI-generated (gemini cli ), but not all of course.
I plan to follow up by upgrading the tool as well (WIP)
